We took some screenshots of our interface to render a preview of our website. 

The screenshots include the scraping process on terminal as well as the different tabs on PandemicTracker.

This would give you a general sense of how the product visually looks like without having to run the code.

Hope these images gives you more incentives to run the codes from your end!
